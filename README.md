# Energy Output Prediction of CCPP using Multiple Linear Regression

This project involves the prediction of energy output in a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) using Multiple Linear Regression in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset contains features such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and exhaust vacuum, which are used to predict the net hourly electrical energy output. Through this analysis, we aim to build a regression model that accurately predicts the energy output based on the given input features.

## Dataset

The CCPP dataset used for this analysis includes various features related to the operation of a Combined Cycle Power Plant, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, exhaust vacuum, and the net hourly electrical energy output.
